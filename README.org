* Curve25519 verification in SPARK2014

/Note/: This repository does not provide a full implementation of
curve25519.

This project was inspired by [[https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/09/07/provers.html][this article]], a "disappointing" attempt to
verify some basic functions from a curve25519 implementation available
[[https://github.com/agl/curve25519-donna][here]].

The SPARK2014 code is a translation from the C code in
[[https://github.com/agl/curve25519-donna][curve25519-donna]] repository.

** Tools used

[[https://www.spark-2014.org/][SPARK2014]] has been used for this project. You may download and install
the [[https://www.adacore.com/community][GNAT Community 2018]] version by following the previous link.

** Verification

To avoid overflow checks in ghost code, a non-executable big
integers library was created, inspired from an [[http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ai12s/ai12-0208-1.txt][upcoming big integers
library in Ada 2020]].

An axiomatization of this library in Why3 was done to be able to use
it in proofs. For more information about external axiomatization in
SPARK, see [[https://blog.adacore.com/external-axiomatizations-a-trip-into-sparks-internals][here]].

** Content of each directory

- ~src~ directory contains all source files: big integers library, files containing ghost code, curve25519 partial implementation
- ~proof/_theories~ contains the external axiomatization for ~src/big_integers.mlw~, as specified in project file ~test.gpr~
